match predictor
use a logistic regression or multinomial model trained on historical matches. You can base it on features like:
Team strength (avg goals for/against)
Home vs Away
Recent form
League position (optional)
Later, you can replace it with Random Forests, XGBoost, or even neural nets.

This is a basic model using goal difference â€” a better one might include form, team averages,  cards, home advantage
